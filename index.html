									<h2>What is street racing?</h2>
									<p>Street Racing comes in two forms: drag and circut. Drag street racing is two cars (usually very powerful) racing down a straight path. these paths are usually a quater-mile to half-mile long. This kind of street racing is dangerous, tough not a fraction as dangerous as circut street racing. Ciruit street racing is two cars (usually on motorways) racing on public roads. Circuit street is MUCH more dangerous. Not only do the cars reach much higher speeds, all the troad becomes the race track including both lanes. Many races include cars which are able to reach 280 kp/Hm, which they usually do. Unfortunately, Hong Kong is home to one of the biggest circuit street racing hubs in Asia (if not the world). Not only does circuit racing opose a big threat to the public, Hong Kong has is worse than Japan. In japan, many drivers are int he late 40s when they purchasse a supercar for the intent of street racing. Though in Hong Kong its different. Many drives make supercar purchases at a younger age, meanin gthey are more naive (and less expirienced) driver. These drivers take risks that street races in Tokyo and other cities in Japan wouldn't take. Plus, street racing is growing by the minute.</p>

									<h2>How does it affect you?</h2>
									<p>Street racing is dangerous, mainly due to where its performed: the public roads. Street racing risks the lives of innocent civilians. Many people are affected by these vile acts. Stay away from street racing locations, they are dangerous places to be! The documentary below shows to street racers in Beverly Hills, USA. The street racers were both diplomats, who are considered "above the law". Though many street racers attempt racing on the sort of roads (as well as main public roads), and obviously opose a threat to everyones lives.</p>
